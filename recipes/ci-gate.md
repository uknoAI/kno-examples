# Gate a deploy on Kno in CI

Goal: fail a build when your agent regresses, without failing it for the wrong reasons.

## Exit codes are the contract

This page is verified as the first stage of the `support-refunds` scenario. That scenario runs
the line below twice — once plain and once with `--json` appended — so the exit code, the
rendered output and the machine-readable document on this page all come from the same real run:

```bash kno-run scenario=support-refunds stage=baseline
kno baseline --evals cases.jsonl --agent fake: --goal exact-match \
  --holdout-frac 0.2 --seed 1 --concurrency 1 \
  --db kno.db --run-id sr-baseline --yes
```

Nothing on this page needs a credential: `fake:` is the default agent, it answers deterministically
and it spends nothing. Everything below holds identically once the agent is a real provider — with
one difference, and it has its own section at the foot of the page.

| Code | Meaning | What CI should do |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Completed | Continue |
| `1` | Failed | Fail the build — something is broken |
| `2` | Stopped at a budget cap | **Not a failure.** The run did what you told it |
| `3` | Validation failed | Fail the build — this is the deploy gate (reserved for `kno validate`) |
| `4` | Interrupted (signal or deadline) | **Not a failure.** Resume it |

The distinction between `1` and the two resumable codes matters. A run that stopped at its spending limit did exactly what you configured, and a run killed by a pod eviction or a job timeout is not broken either. Reporting both as `1` trains people to ignore `1` — which is the one code your gate actually depends on.

```bash
kno baseline --evals cases.jsonl --json > report.json
case $? in
  0)   echo "baseline complete" ;;
  2)   echo "stopped at budget cap; resume or raise it" ; exit 0 ;;
  4)   echo "interrupted; re-run with --resume" ; exit 0 ;;
  *)   echo "baseline failed" ; exit 1 ;;
esac
```

Both `2` and `4` leave a resumable run: work already recorded is never paid for twice.

## Machine-readable output

`--json` emits a stable, hand-written shape aimed at `jq` — not the internal schema, so it won't shift under you when the proto gains a field:

```json
{
  "run_id": "sr-baseline",
  "status": "completed",
  "agent": "fake:",
  "goal": "exact-match",
  "dev_cases": 8,
  "holdout_cases": 4,
  "attempted": 8,
  "scored": 8,
  "errored": 0,
  "score": 1,
  "spent_usd": "$0.00",
  "concurrency": 1,
  "warnings": [
    "the holdout has only 4 cases, too few for a meaningful confidence interval at validate"
  ]
}
```

That is a real document, not a sketch: the fields this page tells you to branch on — `status`,
`attempted`, `errored`, `score`, `spent_usd`, `warnings` — are projected into
`scenarios/support-refunds/expected/baseline.json` and compared against what the binary printed.
A renamed or removed field turns this page red; a field added elsewhere in the document does not,
because the projection holds only what the page claims.

**Check `warnings` in CI.** They qualify the result, and a scripted consumer that ignores them is reading a number without the reason it might be wrong:

```bash
jq -e '.warnings | length == 0' report.json || echo "::warning::$(jq -r '.warnings[]' report.json)"
```

The scenario's own run trips exactly this: twelve Cases leave a four-Case holdout, which is too
few for a meaningful interval at `validate`, and the run says so in `warnings` while still exiting
`0`. A gate that read only the exit code would call that a clean baseline.

**Check `errored` too.** A run where a third of the Cases never got an answer isn't a baseline, and Kno marks it — but your gate should notice:

```bash
jq -e '.errored / .attempted < 0.05' report.json || exit 1
```

## Cap spend

```bash
kno baseline --evals cases.jsonl \
  --max-cost-usd 5.00 \
  --cost-per-call-usd 0.002 \
  --yes
```

`--cost-per-call-usd` tells the guard what a call is expected to cost. It can't refuse what it wasn't told about: a cap checked only at settlement is a cap discovered after the money is gone.

You don't need it for a provider that prices its own calls — `openai:` and `anthropic:` compute every Case from Kno's price table, so `--max-cost-usd 5.00` alone is enough. It **is** required for an agent that can't price itself, and for a model with no table row you supply `--price-input-per-mtok` and `--price-output-per-mtok` instead.

`--yes` proceeds without asking, and prints the figure it's proceeding with — so the number your job agreed to is in the log. In `--json` mode Kno **refuses to spend past the threshold without it**, because a machine-readable run has nobody to answer a prompt and proceeding would spend money with no one watching.

The refusal itself has a code, and it is not `2`. A pre-run consent refusal is a *failure to start*, distinct from a mid-run budget stop: with `--json` it exits `1` (`--json cannot prompt; pass --yes to proceed`), and on a plain non-TTY run it exits `2` (`Re-run with --yes to proceed.`). Either way nothing is spent, and the fix is the same — pass `--yes`. Your job should not need to branch on this: a scheduled run that may cross the threshold gets `--yes`.

## Real spend changes what a red build means

Everything above holds for `fake:`, which costs nothing. Once the agent is a real provider, three things are worth knowing before you schedule it:

- **A failing gate has already cost you money.** The run spent up to its cap before producing the number you gated on. Set `--max-cost-usd` to what you're willing to pay per build, not to what a full run costs.
- **Some failures stop the whole run at the first Case** — a rejected credential, an unpaid account, a model that no longer exists, your provider's own spend cap. These exit `1`, and the Cases that never ran stay unmeasured, so a `--resume` after you fix the cause picks them up rather than skipping them. A wrong key in CI costs you one call, not one per Case.
- **A moving model alias will stop a resume.** `openai:gpt-4.1` is a pointer; if the provider re-points it between the interrupted run and the resume, Kno refuses rather than averaging two models into one score. Pin the version in the ref for a job that resumes.

## Resume in a scheduled job

Rate limits and timeouts happen. A job that stopped can continue rather than starting over:

```bash
kno baseline --evals cases.jsonl --run-id "nightly-$(date +%F)" --max-calls 5000
kno baseline --evals cases.jsonl --run-id "nightly-$(date +%F)" --resume
```

Resume skips completed Cases and reconstructs prior spend from disk, so the cap holds across both invocations.

A resume is refused if the **evals, the goal, or the agent** changed since the run was recorded, and the message names which one. Continuing would average Cases scored under one configuration together with Cases scored under another and present the result as a single number — which looks like one measurement and is not.

## What not to gate on yet

`kno baseline` gives you a reference point, not a verdict. The deploy gate proper is `kno validate`, which measures a selected portfolio against the untouched holdout and exits `3` when it doesn't hold up. That stage isn't built yet.

Until then, useful CI checks are: the baseline completed, the error rate is low, and the score hasn't moved unexpectedly against the run you recorded yesterday.
