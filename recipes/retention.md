# Delete stored conversation content

Goal: keep the numbers, drop the trace content.

## What Kno stores, plainly

Every `kno baseline` run writes a SQLite database (`kno.db` by default) containing, per Case:

| Stored | Is it conversation content? |
|---|---|
| The agent's **output** | **Yes.** Whatever your agent said, verbatim |
| The judge's **rationale**, when a Goal uses one | **Yes.** It quotes and reasons about the output |
| The Case ID, whether it scored, the score, what it cost | No |
| Which Cases completed | No |
| One event per Case on the run's event stream | No — the schema forbids it, and a test enforces that structurally |

If your evals are built from production logs, the first two rows are end-user data sitting on whatever machine ran the command. **Kno itself** sends nothing anywhere: there is no telemetry of content, ever. Your Cases do go to whatever provider you point Kno at — that is the product — and that provider's retention is between you and them. Locally, Kno keeps the results, because a measurement you cannot audit is a measurement you have to take on faith.

**Nothing expires on its own.** There is no retention timer. Deleting is something you do.

## Delete it

```bash
kno purge --run-id 20260821T091515-ffc3097d49da
```

It tells you how many outcomes it would touch and stops, **exiting non-zero** so a scheduled job that forgot `--yes` fails loudly instead of reporting success over data it never removed. Add `--yes` to go through with it.

This page is verified as the last stage of the `support-refunds` scenario, and the transcript
below is that scenario's real output. Purge names a run that must already exist, so
`sh scenarios/support-refunds/run.sh` is what produces it — pasted into a fresh shell against an
empty store, `sr-baseline` is not a run and purge fails rather than silently succeeding, which is
the same refusal a typo in a run id gets.

```bash kno-run scenario=support-refunds stage=purge
kno purge --run-id sr-baseline --db kno.db --yes
```

```
Purged 8 recorded row(s) for run sr-baseline.
The run is still resumable: completion records, costs, and scores were kept.
```

Both of those lines are asserted against the binary by
`scenarios/support-refunds/expected/quotations.json`. Eight, not twelve: the four held-back Cases
were never scored, so there is no recorded output to remove for them. `kno purge` has no `--json`
form in kno v0.1.2, so this stage is asserted by quotation alone.

This cannot be undone. Purge zeroes the freed pages and rewrites the database file, so the content is gone from the bytes on disk and not merely unlinked from a column — `strings kno.db` finds nothing. That rewrite is why purging a large database takes a moment.

## What survives, and why that is not a loophole

Purge removes the agent's output and the judge's rationale. It keeps the Case ID, the score, the cost, and the fact that the Case completed.

That is not Kno hedging about deletion — it is the difference between "what was said" and "what it measured." A score of `0.82` is not conversation content, and neither is `$0.003`.

**Purging today does not cost you the baseline.** Resume a purged run and the report reads normally:

```
Baseline demo
  cases      44 scored, 0 errored (of 44 dev; 6 held back)
  score      0.818
  status     completed
```

The score lives in its own column, not inside the blob a purge nulls, so it survives and a resumed run reports the mean over the whole run.

**The exception is a run purged by an older build.** Before the score had a column of its own, it lived inside the response blob — so a purge from that era took the numbers with it. Those Cases are complete, and their scores are unrecoverable without paying to run them again. That run reports:

```
Baseline demo
  cases      44 scored, 0 errored (of 44 dev; 6 held back)
  score      none
  status     completed

  warning: some cases' scores cannot be read back, so this run has no
           baseline number — the cases themselves are intact

  12 of 44 scored Cases can no longer contribute a number — purged before
  scores were stored separately, or holding a Score that could not be read
  back — so this run has no reportable aggregate
```

Kno reports no number rather than the mean over the 32 Cases that still have one. That mean would be a real number describing a population nobody chose, printed beside a count that spans the whole run. `--json` carries the same distinction as `"score": null` with `"score_unavailable": true`, so a machine consumer can tell it from a run that genuinely scored nothing.

The same message covers a Score blob that fails to read back for any other reason — a corrupt row, or one written by a build this one does not understand. The count tells you how much of the run is affected, which is what decides whether re-running is worth the money.

See [What the numbers mean](https://github.com/uknoAI/kno/blob/main/docs/what-the-numbers-mean.md#a-purged-run-has-no-baseline-score) for why refusing beats averaging the survivors.

**Spend the run could not attribute to a Case survives too.** A Case that was charged for an
attempt and then refused by the budget — or interrupted mid-backoff — has no outcome to hang its
cost on, so that money is recorded against the run itself rather than against a Case. Purge does
not touch it, for the same reason it keeps the scores: a dollar figure is not conversation
content, and losing it would let a resumed run spend its cap a second time.

Which Case the money went to is *recorded* on the event stream — an `OrphanSpend` event names
the Case, the amount, and whether the run stopped because it hit its budget or because someone
interrupted it — and purge leaves the events table alone, so it survives.

**You cannot read it back yet.** There is no `kno` command that replays a past run's events, and
no API. The record exists so the answer is not lost; surfacing it is still to come. Until then a
purged run can tell you what it cost and which Cases completed, and for these particular charges
it cannot tell you which Case they belonged to.

Keeping them is also load-bearing. **Kno has no separate "this Case is done" marker: the recorded outcome _is_ the marker.** Delete those rows and a resumed run has no way to know the work happened, so it runs every Case again and pays for every Case again. A purge that reopened the double-spend hole would be a privacy feature that costs you money.

So `kno purge` nulls the content columns and never deletes a row. If you want the rows gone too, delete the database file — that is a real and supported answer, and it makes the run unresumable, which is the honest trade.

### Both kinds of recorded work

Kno records a Case two ways, and purge covers both.

A **Baseline** run records one *outcome* per Case. A **Value** run records one *measurement* per Case per Asset per arm — the same Case measured many times, because that is what comparing Assets means — and those live in their own table with their own key. A measurement's response holds exactly the same end-user conversation content an outcome's does.

Purge clears the content columns of both, in one transaction, and the count it prints before asking spans both. That is why it says **recorded row(s)** rather than "outcome(s)": for a Value run the number is entirely measurements, and the old wording reported outcomes about a run that has none.

Both halves matter. A purge that cleared only outcomes would print a count larger than what it removed and report success over content still on disk — which is worse than failing, because you would act on the report. And clearing them in two separate statements would let the second fail after the first destroyed content, returning an error with no count: told nothing was removed, after removal.

## In a scheduled job

```bash
# Yesterday's nightly baseline: keep the score, drop the trace content
kno purge --run-id "nightly-$(date -I -d yesterday)" --yes
```

Purging a run that does not exist is an error rather than a silent success, so a typo in the run ID fails the job instead of quietly keeping data you meant to remove. Omitting `--yes` fails the same way, for the same reason.

**A run that is still executing is refused.** Cases finishing after the purge would write fresh output, and the command would have reported success over content that reappeared seconds later. Wait for it to end, or pass `--force` if you know it is not running.

Purge is per-run today. Bulk retention across every run older than *N* days is not built yet.

## What purge does not cover

- **Your eval file.** Kno reads `--evals` and never modifies it. If it contains user data, that file is yours to manage.
- **Exported artifacts.** Anything you wrote to disk from a report.
- **Provider-side logs.** Your LLM provider's retention is between you and them; check their policy.
- **Backups of `kno.db`.** Purge touches the database you point it at, nothing else.

### Traces are content-free on purpose

Kno emits OpenTelemetry spans for every run, Case, and provider call. **They carry IDs, counts, and money — never a prompt, an answer, or a system prompt.**

One caveat worth stating plainly: the **Case ID is one of those IDs**, and Kno takes it verbatim from your eval file. If your IDs are derived from your content — a common shortcut when they come from source rows — then that content is in your traces. Give Cases labels (`refund-01`) rather than IDs cut from the question text.

That is not a courtesy, it is what keeps this page true. A span is designed to leave the machine; once it reaches a collector it is somewhere `kno purge` cannot follow. So the rule is enforced in code rather than by convention: the tracing package's attribute helpers accept no content, error *codes* are recorded instead of error messages (a wrapped provider error can quote the prompt that produced it), and a test drives a real run — with an agent whose errors deliberately quote the Case — and scans every attribute, event, and status on every span for that content.

`--trace-spans` writes them to stderr for local debugging. Export to a collector is not in this release.
