# Point Kno at your own provider

Everything so far has used `fake:`, the local agent that costs nothing. This is the recipe for measuring a real one — an OpenAI or Anthropic model, a compatible gateway, or a model server on your own machine.

Read this before the first run that can bill you.

## The short version

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

kno baseline \
  --evals cases.jsonl \
  --agent openai:gpt-4.1 \
  --max-cost-usd 2.00
```

That is a complete, capped run. Kno prices every Case from its own table, so you do not have to tell it what a call costs.

## Keys come from the environment, never from a flag

There is no `--api-key`, and there will not be one. A key on a command line is written to your shell history, shown in `ps` output to every user on the machine, and captured in CI logs.

Each scheme reads a default variable:

| Scheme | Variable |
|---|---|
| `openai:` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `anthropic:` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |

For any **other** host you must say which variable holds its key:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...

kno baseline --evals cases.jsonl \
  --agent openai:llama-3.3-70b \
  --base-url https://api.groq.com/openai/v1 \
  --key-env api.groq.com=GROQ_API_KEY
```

`--key-env` takes `host=VARIABLE_NAME`. The **name** of a variable is not a secret; the key itself still only ever comes from the environment.

This is not ceremony. Kno will not fall back to `OPENAI_API_KEY` for a host that is not OpenAI's, because that would mail your OpenAI key to whoever you pointed `--base-url` at.

A host with no binding simply gets no credential — which is correct for a local model server, and produces a 401 from anything else. For the provider's **own** default host (`api.openai.com`, `api.anthropic.com`) a missing key is refused before any request, since that host certainly needs one.

## Capping spend

Two caps, and they bound different things:

```bash
--max-cost-usd 5.00    # stop before spending more than this
--max-calls 500        # stop after this many agent calls
```

A run that hits either stops **resumably**: `--resume` continues where it left off without paying for anything twice. The exit code is `2`, not `1` — a budget stop is the run doing what it was told, not a failure.

What you repeat on every run can live in `kno.yaml` instead of the command line — `kno init` writes one, and it can carry `agent`, `base_url`, `key_env`, `goal`, `max_cost_usd`, and `max_calls`. The consent booleans (`--yes`, `--accept-unknown-cost`, the security waivers) are deliberately flags-only: a committed `yes: true` would be a silent consent waiver shared with every teammate.

Above **$1.00** estimated, Kno asks before starting. On a terminal the dialog prints the bounded figure and takes one of three answers: `[y]es`, `[n]o`, or `[c]hange the cap` — changing the cap re-quotes the same figure against the new headroom, and agreeing to it is the consent. On a non-TTY run there is nobody to ask: it prints the figure and `Re-run with --yes to proceed.`, then exits `2` with nothing spent. In `--json` mode it refuses the same way at exit `1` (`--json cannot prompt; pass --yes to proceed`). A scheduled run needs `--yes` up front — a machine-readable run has nobody to answer a prompt.

`--yes` still prints what it is agreeing to (`Proceeding with --yes: this run would spend about $5.00 across 13 Cases.`), so the number is in your scrollback and in your CI log.

### If your model has no price

Kno's price table does not cover every model, and it deliberately refuses to guess. The rule behind the table: **a version suffix inherits, a variant does not.** `claude-opus-5-20260821` resolves to the `claude-opus-5` row (a dated pin prices like its base), but `claude-opus-5-fast` is its own product with its own published rate — before fast mode had table rows, a prefix match silently authorized it at the base rate, and that failure is why variant words never inherit (the fast rows exist now; `kno doctor` shows them).

Under a cost cap, an unpriced model is refused **once**, before any Case runs. Supply the rates yourself:

```bash
--price-input-per-mtok 3.00 --price-output-per-mtok 15.00
```

Both are required. Half a price produces an estimate that is wrong in the direction that under-reserves, which is a cap that does not bind.

`kno doctor` prints which models the table covers and the date the table was taken.

## A local model server

vLLM, Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio — anything speaking the OpenAI chat-completions shape:

```bash
kno baseline --evals cases.jsonl \
  --agent openai:my-local-model \
  --base-url http://localhost:8000/v1 \
  --allow-insecure-base-url \
  --allow-private-address \
  --cost-per-call-usd 0
```

Three flags need explaining, and each is a separate opt-in on purpose — somebody who needs a loopback address should not also be waiving TLS to the public internet:

- **`--allow-insecure-base-url`** permits plain `http://`.
- **`--allow-private-address`** permits loopback and private ranges. Link-local (`169.254.0.0/16`) is **not** covered and cannot be opted into: `169.254.169.254` is where cloud instance metadata lives, and a tool that fetches a URL and stores the response body has no business reaching it.
- **`--cost-per-call-usd 0`** states that these calls are free. Passing it *explicitly* is the claim; leaving it out is not, and without either that flag or `--accept-unknown-cost` Kno refuses to start rather than spending an amount nobody can state.

Older servers may need `--use-legacy-max-tokens`, which sends `max_tokens` instead of `max_completion_tokens`.

## Anthropic

```bash
kno baseline --evals cases.jsonl \
  --agent anthropic:claude-opus-5 \
  --max-output-tokens 1024 \
  --max-cost-usd 2.00
```

`--max-output-tokens` is **required** here: the Messages API requires `max_tokens`, and a cost cap cannot bound an output term that has no ceiling.

The full Anthropic recipe — the priced models and their rates, the `--accept-unknown-cost` path, and a complete baseline→value→select→export→report example — is [its own page](anthropic.md).

## Naming the endpoint

Two equivalent forms:

```bash
--agent openai:gpt-4.1@https://gateway.example.com/v1
--agent openai:gpt-4.1 --base-url https://gateway.example.com/v1
```

Use one or the other. Passing both is refused — two ways of saying the same thing, disagreeing, is a mistake rather than an ordering question.

The URL must be an **endpoint root**, absolute, with a scheme. Not a request URL: anything after the root would be appended to every request Kno makes, so a query string or a fragment is refused.

**Never put a credential in the URL.** `https://user:pass@host` is refused, and so is `?api_key=...`. A base URL is recorded on the Run, emitted on the event stream, and printed in `--json` — so a key placed there ends up in four durable places at once. A credential inside the URL **path** is not currently detected, because a path segment is indistinguishable from a legitimate route prefix; use `--key-env`.

## Redirects are refused

Kno does not follow them, cross-host or same-host. Go's HTTP client strips `Authorization` on a cross-domain redirect but **not** `x-api-key`, which is how Anthropic authenticates — so a base URL that redirects elsewhere would forward that key verbatim. Point `--base-url` at the endpoint directly.

## When a run stops early

Some failures cannot get better by trying again: a rejected credential, an unpaid account, a model name that does not exist, your provider's own spend cap. Kno stops the whole run on the first one, rather than making the same doomed request for every remaining Case.

The Cases it did not measure stay unmeasured — fix the problem and `--resume`, and they are picked up rather than skipped.

## Seeing where the time went

```bash
kno baseline --evals cases.jsonl --agent openai:gpt-4.1 --max-cost-usd 2.00 --trace-spans
```

Writes an OpenTelemetry span for the run, each Case, and each provider call to stderr — which separates provider latency from Kno's own, and shows retries as what they are. Spans carry IDs, counts, and cost only, never your prompts or the answers; see [retention](retention.md#traces-are-content-free-on-purpose).

## Checking what is supported

```bash
kno doctor
```

Prints the adapters, which cost money, the goals, and the price table's date. It contacts nothing and reads no credential, so it is safe to run while diagnosing a failed run.
